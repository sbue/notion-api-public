# notion-api-public
Personal project. Private API to allow me to log personal metrics on Notion

Also includes code for scheduling tasks that I do every day (such as creating a jorunal). I hooked this API to a chatbot (using https://chatfuel.com/ free version), so that I can quickly log metrics on the go. Here are some screenshots of the chatbot in action.
